## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
categories := []string{"tshirt", "trouser", "pullover", "dress", "coat",
"sandal", "shirt", "shoe", "bag", "boot"}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers and data scientists with at least beginner-level knowledge of Go, and a vague idea of what types of problem Machine Learning aims to tackle. No advanced knowledge of Go (and no theoretical understanding of the math that underpins Machine Learning) is required.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-7).
